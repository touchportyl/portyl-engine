// Optimize function calling conventions for vector operations and other performance-sensitive code.
// It is designed to optimize the passing of arguments in functions that use vector or
// SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations.
//#define __FLX_VECTORCALL __vectorcall

// The compiler ensures that the starting address of the variable is divisible by X.
// 
// Example usage: __FLX_ALIGNAS(16) float myArray[4];
// Each float is 4 bytes, so the array is 16 bytes.
// 
// Proper alignment can improve memory access performance, particularly when dealing with
// vectorized operations, SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, or GPU operations.
// 
// Misaligned memory access can result in performance penalties because the CPU or GPU
// may need to perform additional work to handle unaligned access.
